#  ðŸŽ“ C# Camp Projects
This repository contains projects I completed during the C# camp given by Murat YÃ¼cedaÄŸ.

## ðŸ”Ž Project 1: Main Subjects
Through this project, I learned printing to the console using the Console.WriteLine() command, along with string and integer variables. I printed my first 'Hello World!' message.

## ðŸ”Ž Project 2: Variables
In this project, I learned how to define and work with various data types such as int,string and double variables, taking user input from the keyboard.

## ðŸ”Ž Project 3: Making Decisions
In this project, I worked with if, else if, and else structures to build decision-making mechanisms, including mode taking operations,char variables and a simple calculator with swtich case.

## ðŸ”Ž Proect 4: Loops
In this project, I explored for loops, decision-making structures and while loops.

## ðŸ”Ž Project 6: Arrays
In this project, I learned how to work with arrays, methods to list multiple values within an array and use loops to process these values.

## ðŸ”Ž Project 7: Foreach Loop
In this project, I learned about the foreach loop and developed an exam application that takes student's name and their grades as input from the user, which determines their success based on the average score.

## ðŸ”Ž Project 8: Methods
I learned to optimize my code using methods, including void methods, string parameterized methods, and integer parameterized methods.
